Discord Pinarchiver
===================
Automatically saves pinned messages to a channel in order to bypass the 50 pin limit imposed by discord. On top of this, the bot provides various commands for easier pin management as described below.

Setup
-----
```
1. To set up this bot use the `@pinarchiver init` command in a channel where you want to create the pin archive. NOTE:  You need `Manage Messages` permission to set up this bit for security reasons
2. Then use `initpinarchive CHANNEL_1 CHANNEL_2 ... CHANNEL_N` to archive the pins in the given channels
3. This will now make all new pins be saved to the indicated channel, when a channel runs out of pin space use `purgepins CHANNEL` to reset it. Alternatively, multiple channels can have pins reset in a similar fashion as `initpinarchive`.
```
